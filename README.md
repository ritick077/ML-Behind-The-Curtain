• Implemented a 2-class classification Neural network with single Hidden layer for a planar data using forward and back prop-
  agation on varying sizes of hidden layers and compared its accuracy with a Logistic regression model
• Implemented Gradient descend algorithm and trained the model using various training functions using Numpy and Pandas
• Explored various Machine Learning concepts including linear algebra, Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression,
  Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Associate rule learning and Clustering
